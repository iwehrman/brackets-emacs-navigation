Brackets Emacs Navigation
=========================

A Brackets extension that provides a handful of emacs-style navigation commands. Currently, the only commands are: 

1. back-to-indentation (Cmd-Shift-M), which jumps to the first non-whitespace character on the line; 
2. jump-to-home (Cmd-<), which jumps to the first character in the file; and 
3. jump-to-end (Cmd->), which jumps to the last character in the file.
